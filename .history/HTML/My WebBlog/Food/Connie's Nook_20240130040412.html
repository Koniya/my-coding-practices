    <h1 id="1topic">The Bitter Gourd</h1>
    <section>
        <p>When I was a kid, I would always find a meal as unappetizing. Either the food taste was too strong, or bland, or the smell was disgusting. I didn't like any meat, fish, and vegetables. I would always end up eating rice soaked in soup, or rice and sugar.</p> 
        <p>One day, I was forced to eat a newly cooked vegetable dish. I couldn't remember why aunts and uncles did it to me. Maybe because they were trying to help me take in the nutritious yet bitter vegetable. However, when I started chewing the crunchy piece of bitter gourd, it did some tingling on my tongue. There were bursts of saltiness, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, and other tastes that I couldn't identify. The taste was so balanced that it made my taste buds alive! I exclaimed, "This is so good!" The adults were puzzled. How come an 11-year-old picky eater enjoyed eating the bitter gourd.</p>
        <p>That event marked the beginning of my food journey.</p></section>

    <section>
        <p>On my 6th grade, my father's aunt took care of my education expenses. I had to live with her. So I was transferred to another elementary school. That was the 4th time of school transfer throughout the six years of elementary school program. It was another round of adjustments for me.</p> 
        <p>The people in this new environment were too different from where I had been. Specifically, they had a different set of food. There were soft drinks, barbecue, and many prepared food from food shops. One day, Lola &rbrack;had visitors. They brought boxes of food. One of which contains what they called a pizza. Upon opening the box, a delicious smell of cheese filled the small living room. It looked appetizing. My uncle asked if I had tasted a pizza. It was the first time I had seen such a circular food. So they gave me a slice of pizza. One small bite, I tasted a kind of weird plastic taste. I was expecting a taste similar to cheddar cheese which I was more familiar. Then another bite, my stomach grumbled. I felt so uncomfortable that I went to the toilet to puke.</p>
        <p>That was my first impression of the pizza. It looked and smelled appetizing, but there was this unnatural taste. It took years before my taste bud got acquainted to its taste. Now, I have my favorite: the Dear Darla of Yellow Cab Pizza. </p></section>
