    <section>
        <p>When I was a kid, I would always find a meal as unappetizing. Either the food taste was too strong, or bland, or the smell was disgusting. I didn't like any meat, fish, and vegetables. I would always end up eating rice soaked in soup, or rice and sugar.</p> 
        <p>One day, I was forced to eat a newly cooked vegetable dish. I couldn't remember why aunts and uncles did it to me. Maybe because they were trying to help me take in the nutritious yet bitter vegetable. However, when I started chewing the crunchy piece of bitter gourd, it did some tingling on my tongue. There were bursts of saltiness, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, and other tastes that I couldn't identify. The taste was so balanced that it made my taste buds alive! I exclaimed, "This is so good!" The adults were puzzled. How come an 11-year-old picky eater enjoyed eating the bitter gourd.</p>
        <p>That event marked the beginning of my food journey.</p></section>
