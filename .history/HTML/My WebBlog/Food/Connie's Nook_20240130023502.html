    <h1>At Connie's Nook</h1>
    <div>When I was a kid, food was something that I would always find disgusting. Either the taste was too strong, or the smell was pungent, or it was bland. One day, I was forced to eat a newly cooked bitter vegetable dish. I couldn't remember why aunts and uncles did it to me. Maybe because they were trying to make me eat the nutritious yet bitter vegetable. However, when I started chewing the crunchy piece of bitter gourd, it did some tingling on my tongue. There were bursts of saltiness, sweetness, bitterness, sourness, and other tastes that I couldn't identify. The taste was so balanced that it made my taste buds alive. I commented, "This is do good!" The adults were puzzled. How come an 11-year-old picky eater enjoyed eating the bitter gourd. That event marked the beginning of my food journey.</div>
